This repository contains solutions to two introductory Python programming tasks:

1.  **Perform Basic Mathematical Operations:** A program that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.  **Create a Personalized Greeting:** A program that takes a user's first and last name and generates a personalized greeting.

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

### Description

This Python script, `AssignmentTask1.py`, prompts the user to enter two numbers. It then performs the four basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on these numbers and displays the result of each operation.
### How to Run

1.  Save the code as `AssignmentTask1.py`.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python AssignmentTask1.py
    ```
5.  Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.

    #####Output
5.  Follow the prompts to enter the two numbers.
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
10 + 5 = 15
10 - 5 = 5
10 * 5 = 50
10 / 5 = 2.0









## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

### Description

The `Assignmenttask2.py` script takes the user's first name and last name as input. It then concatenates these inputs to form a full name and prints a personalized greeting message using this full name.

### How to Run
1.  Save the code as `Assignmenttask2.py`.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python Assignmenttask2.py
    ```
5.  Follow the prompts to enter your first and last names.
### Expected Output

Enter your first name: John
Enter your last name: Doe
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
